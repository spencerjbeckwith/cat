# CAT

Platform game involving two cats named Emily and Jane, fighting an adventure to finally return home, or something. I don't know yet but it's gonna be written in 6502 assembly cause I'm obviously a masochist. Might not turn out well but at least it'll be a *learning experience*.

If you want to keep up to date with me for some reason (I don't know why you ever would lul) you can download the ROM from here, though it'll probably be buggy and incomplete until I'm actually done. You could also build it using `npm run compile` which just uses NESASM. So make sure that's added to your environment variable or add it to your directory.

## Planned features:
- Platformer game
- Two player
- Who knows, this is just for fun

## Do next:
- Make PPU buffer
- Make Game state machine
- PLAN what you're making you numbnutz
